# Election_Analysis
## Project Overview
The objective of the election analysis project is use to to provide an audit of results of a recent local congressional election in coloroado
At the end of the analysis our python script will be able to give the following details:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.9.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.56.0

## Initial Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
- The candidates were:
- Charles Casper Stockham
- Diana DeGette
- Raymon Anthony Doane
#### The candidate results were:
- Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.
- Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
- Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes.
#### The winner of the election was:
- Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.

## Overview of Election Audit
### This section provides insight into the the purpose of this election audit analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to audit the tabulated results for a US congressional precinct in Colorado. This analysis will provide data on the following:
  - The voter turnout for each county
  - The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
  - The county with the highest turnout
Working from the data source: election_results.csv file, this analysis utilized for loops and conditional statements with membership and logical operators to find the requested results. Then, printed the results to the command line and saved them to an election_results.txt file.

#### Control Flow
1. Add our dependenies
2. Add variables to load and save our source and target files respectively
3. Initialize a total votes counter variable
4. Create empty lists to hold each county and each candidate
5. Create empty dictionary to hold candidate votes and county votes
6. Declare variables to track the winning candidate, vote count and percentage
7. Declare variables to track the largest county and county voter turnout.
8. Using the csv.reader method, read the source file and convert it into a list of dictionaries to fetch candidate name, county name, and vote count for candiatate and county
9. Open the target file and save the election results
10. Write a for loop to get the count from the county dictionary.
11. Calculate the percentage of votes for the county
12. Print the county results to the terminal and save to the target text file.
13. Write an if statement to determine the winning county and get its vote count.
14. Print the county with the largest turnout to the terminal and save to the target text file.
15. Using csv's write method, save the final candidate vote count to the text file.
16. Using an if statement, determine winning vote count, winning percentage, and candidate.

### Election-Audit Results
  - There were 369,711 votes cast in this congressional election. this number agrees with the initial election summary provided.

### Election-Audit Summary
#### The Ask
The election commission explores how this script can be used for any election, with two examples for modifying the script
If we decomposed the ask by making the following assumptions:
1. users of the script may or may not have knowledge of python and they would require an easy way to specify their csv file
2. we may or may not assume that every csv file will have three columns with Candidate name and County name as the second and third columns

##### Define Data Source
we may propose a solution that provides the us an input to enter a url to their csv. we would ensure to have a central file repository where different counties can upload the csv files
an alternative is to provide user with he ability to input the name of their csv file and the parent folder of the file. we would then use an indirect path method to locate and read the file on the users machine

##### Column Names and Column Position
With the assumption that column names and position will not always be same for all csv files across all preccincts, we may modify our code to allow the user input the column name that contains county name and candidate name.

By implementing these two modifications, our script can be used for any county across the US.

Our modified control flow may look like the following:
1. Add our dependencies
2. Declare a user input variable for the file name and the parent folder
3. Read the column names as output to the user and request confirmation for county column and candidate column
4. Set county name and candidate name to the columns provided by the user
5. We may then pocess the rest of the script as before to determine total votes, candidates summary, and county summary
